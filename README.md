Sonivox EAS for Linux and Qt
============================

This project is a Linux MIDI Synth library based on the Sonivox EAS Synthesizer published by Google on the Android Open Source Project.
It is a real time GM synthesizer without needing external soundfonts, using embedded samples instead. It consumes very little resources, so
it may be indicated in Linux projects for small embedded devices.

The library uses ALSA Sequencer MIDI input and libAO Audio output. Complete compile-time dependencies are:
* Qt5, http://www.qt.io/
* Drumstick, for ALSA MIDI input. http://sourceforge.net/projects/drumstick/
* LibAO, for audio output. http://xiph.org/ao/

The project directory contains:
* cmdlnsynth: Command line sample program using the synthesizer library
* guisynth: GUI sample program using the synthesizer library
* libsvoxeas: The Linux synthesizer shared library, using ALSA Sequencer and LibAO Audio output
* sonivox: The AOSP source files, with a qmake project file to compile and test under QtCreator as a static library
